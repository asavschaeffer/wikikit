# Usage Patterns: Real-World WikiKit Workflows

> Practical patterns for applying WikiKit extraction techniques in various contexts

## Core Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Post-Brainstorm Extraction

**When to Use**: After messy brainstorming sessions with scattered ideas and evolving concepts

**Process**:

1. **Immediate Capture**: Run extraction while conversation is fresh
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify themes across scattered discussion
3. **Gap Identification**: Flag missing critical information
4. **Structure Creation**: Organize insights into implementation-ready format

**Best Practices**:

- Don't clean up the messiness‚Äîextract it faithfully
- Preserve contradictions and evolution
- Mark assumptions and uncertainties clearly
- Cross-reference related ideas

üîÑ **EVOLVED**: v2.0 Enhancement - Conversation Reality Handling

**Initially**: Assumed brainstorm conversations were coherent progressions  
**Changed to**: Systematic handling of contradictions, pivots, and half-formed ideas  
**Reason**: Real conversations involve "half-baked stuff, lots of contradictions, lots of toss ups between stacks and implementations and target audiences"

**v2.0 Enhanced Process**:

1. **Reality Extraction**: Capture contradictions and evolution with `üîÑ EVOLVED` markers
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Apply systematic resolution framework for contradictory statements
3. **Gap Marking**: Extract incomplete ideas and mark specific missing details
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Generate categories specific to conversation context

**Example Output**:

```markdown
üîÑ EVOLVED: Target Architecture Approach

- **Initially**: "Let's use microservices for scalability" (engineering team preference)
- **Changed to**: "Monolith first, then split when we prove product-market fit" (CTO decision)
- **Reason**: Reduced complexity prioritized for faster iteration and smaller team

‚ùì CLARIFICATION: Database choice - PostgreSQL vs MongoDB

- **PostgreSQL camp**: ACID compliance for financial data
- **MongoDB camp**: Schema flexibility for rapid iteration
- **Resolution needed**: Technical team alignment meeting
- **Blocks**: API design and data migration planning
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Documentation Building

**When to Use**: Building comprehensive project documentation incrementally

**Original Sequence**:

```
Product Research ‚Üí Project Vision ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Technical Feasibility ‚Üí High-Level Design
```

üîÑ **EVOLVED**: v2.0 Complete Strategic Documentation Workflow

**Initially**: 4-document workflow with gap between vision and requirements  
**Added**: Development Roadmap as critical bridge document  
**Reason**: "A lot of the time when talking with LLM I break down project into phases, MVP phase, various additions, maybe phase 2, final end phase, super end phase"

**Enhanced v2.0 Sequence**:

```
1. Product Research & Discovery (v2.0) ‚Üê Market intelligence
   ‚Üì
2. Project Vision (v2.0) ‚Üê Strategic direction
   ‚Üì
3. Development Roadmap (v2.0) ‚Üê NEW! Phased execution planning
   ‚Üì (MVP ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Future phases)
4. Functional Requirements (v2.0) ‚Üê What to build
   ‚Üì
5. Technical Feasibility & ADR (v2.0) ‚Üê How to build
   ‚Üì
6. High-Level Design ‚Üê Architectural blueprint
```

**Benefits of Enhanced Workflow**:

- **Complete Coverage**: No gaps between strategic vision and tactical requirements
- **Phased Planning**: Captures MVP vs full product vs future vision discussions
- **Resource Planning**: Timeline and team evolution across phases
- **Success Criteria**: Clear metrics for phase transitions

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement

**When to Use**: Conversations evolve over multiple sessions with new information

**Original Process**:

1. Initial extraction from first conversation
2. Update documentation as new discussions occur
3. Track how requirements and decisions change
4. Maintain version history of key decisions

üîÑ **EVOLVED**: v2.0 Enhancement - Evolution-Aware Refinement

**Enhanced Process**:

1. **Baseline Extraction**: Initial comprehensive extraction with v2.0 markers
2. **Evolution Tracking**: Add new conversations and track changes with `üîÑ EVOLVED`
3. **Conflict Integration**: Resolve new contradictions using v2.0 resolution framework
4. **Gap Resolution**: Update previous gaps with new information
5. **Consistency Validation**: Ensure decision markers remain consistent across updates

**Example Evolution Log**:

```markdown
### Requirements Evolution History

**Week 1 Extraction**:
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Basic user authentication with email/password"

**Week 3 Update**:  
üîÑ EVOLVED: Authentication requirements

- **Initially**: "Basic email/password login" (Week 1 technical discussion)
- **Changed to**: "OAuth + SSO integration required" (Week 3 enterprise user feedback)
- **Trigger**: 80% of target users need SSO for corporate compliance
- **Impact**: Architecture complexity increased, timeline extended 2 weeks

**Week 5 Refinement**:
üîÑ EVOLVED: Authentication timeline

- **Initially**: "OAuth + SSO in MVP" (Week 3 decision)
- **Refined to**: "OAuth in MVP, SSO in Phase 2" (Week 5 timeline pressure)
- **Trigger**: Investor demo deadline prioritizes core functionality
```

### Pattern 4: Team Knowledge Transfer

**When to Use**: Sharing conversation insights with team members who weren't present

**Process**:

1. **Context Preservation**: Extract not just decisions but reasoning
2. **Stakeholder Attribution**: Show who said what and why
3. **Decision Journey**: Capture how conclusions were reached
4. **Open Questions**: Highlight what still needs team input

üîÑ **EVOLVED**: v2.0 Enhancement - Stakeholder Voice Separation

**Added**: Systematic capture of different perspectives within conversations
**Format**: Track viewpoints by role/person with source attribution
**Benefit**: Team members can understand different stakeholder concerns

**Example Transfer Document**:

```markdown
### Architecture Discussion Summary

**Engineering Lead Perspective** (Alex):
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Microservices enable team autonomy and independent deployment"

- **Concern**: Monolith will become bottleneck as team grows
- **Priority**: Technical scalability and development velocity

**CTO Perspective** (Jordan):  
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Monolith first - prove product-market fit before optimizing for scale"

- **Concern**: Premature optimization adds complexity without clear benefit
- **Priority**: Time to market and iteration speed

**Product Manager Input** (Sam):
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Whatever gets us to user validation fastest"

- **Constraint**: Must demo to investors in 8 weeks
- **Priority**: Feature completeness over technical elegance

**Resolution Status**:
‚ùì CLARIFICATION: Architecture decision pending technical strategy meeting

- **Participants**: Alex (Engineering), Jordan (CTO), Sam (Product)
- **Timeline**: Decision needed by Friday for infrastructure planning
- **Impact**: Blocks development environment setup and team planning
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Pattern 5: Cross-Document Consistency Validation

**When to Use**: Ensuring extracted information is consistent across document suite

**Original Approach**: Manual review for contradictions
**v2.0 Enhancement**: Standardized decision markers enable automatic consistency checking

**v2.0 Process**:

1. **Marker Standardization**: All documents use identical decision marker format
2. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Same decisions should have same evidence across documents
3. **Gap Propagation**: Missing information in one document flagged for others
4. **Evolution Synchronization**: Decision changes tracked consistently across suite

**Example Consistency Check**:

```markdown
## Cross-Document Validation Example

**Project Vision**:
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Target enterprise teams with 10-50 employees"

**Requirements Document**:  
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Support team workspaces with 10-50 member capacity"

**Technical Feasibility**:
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "Architecture must scale to 50 concurrent users per workspace"

**Development Roadmap**:
‚úÖ VERIFIED: "MVP targets teams of 10-50, Phase 2 adds enterprise features for larger teams"

‚Üí **Status**: Consistent extraction across all documents ‚úì
```

### Pattern 6: Domain-Specific Adaptation

**When to Use**: Projects in specialized industries requiring domain expertise

üîÑ **EVOLVED**: v2.0 Enhancement - Dynamic Category Generation

**Initially**: Fixed extraction categories assumed to work for all projects  
**Changed to**: Automatic adaptation to domain-specific conversation content  
**Reason**: Healthcare, fintech, gaming, and other domains have unique functional areas not covered by generic categories

**Implementation Pattern**:

1. **Domain Detection**: Analyze conversation for industry-specific terminology
2. **Category Generation**: Create appropriate functional areas based on context
3. **Pattern Adaptation**: Adjust extraction patterns for domain complexity
4. **Standard Integration**: Combine domain categories with universal patterns

**Domain Examples**:

**Healthcare Project**:

```markdown
# Auto-generated from conversation mentioning "patient data", "HIPAA", "clinical workflows"

dynamic_categories:
clinical_workflows: "Patient intake, diagnosis tracking, treatment protocols"
compliance_requirements: "HIPAA audit trails, data retention, patient consent"
integration_systems: "EHR interfaces, lab connections, billing systems"
```

**Fintech Project**:

```markdown
# Auto-generated from conversation mentioning "KYC", "trading", "compliance"

dynamic_categories:
regulatory_compliance: "KYC verification, AML monitoring, audit reporting"
financial_operations: "Transaction processing, risk management, settlement"
security_requirements: "Fraud detection, encryption, secure communications"
```

**Gaming Project**:

```markdown
# Auto-generated from conversation mentioning "players", "monetization", "levels"

dynamic_categories:
game_mechanics: "Player progression, achievement systems, difficulty scaling"
monetization_features: "In-app purchases, subscription tiers, virtual economy"
social_systems: "Multiplayer mechanics, chat, leaderboards"
```

### Pattern 7: Conversation Complexity Navigation

**When to Use**: Handling real-world conversation messiness systematically

üîÑ **EVOLVED**: v2.0 Enhancement - Advanced Complexity Handling

**Added**: Systematic patterns for common conversation complexity scenarios

**Scenario 1: Stakeholder Disagreement**

```markdown
**Pattern**: Capture all perspectives with source attribution
**Example**:

**Engineering Team**: "We need React for component reusability"
**Design Team**: "Vue is simpler for our skill level"  
**CTO**: "Angular for enterprise-grade TypeScript support"

‚ùì CLARIFICATION: Frontend framework choice

- **Engineering concern**: Component ecosystem and hiring pool
- **Design concern**: Learning curve and development speed
- **CTO concern**: Long-term maintainability and type safety
- **Resolution method**: Technical spike comparing all three
- **Decision timeline**: End of sprint for architecture decisions
```

**Scenario 2: Half-Formed Ideas**

```markdown
**Pattern**: Extract what exists, mark specific gaps
**Example**:

Conversation: "We should probably have some kind of dashboard with... you know, analytics and stuff"

‚ùå GAP: Analytics requirements undefined

- **What was mentioned**: "Some kind of dashboard with analytics"
- **Missing specifics**:
  - Which metrics to track (user engagement? revenue? performance?)
  - Who are the dashboard users (admins? end users? executives?)
  - Update frequency (real-time? daily? weekly?)
  - Visualization types (charts? tables? alerts?)
- **Why critical**: Affects database design, API requirements, UI complexity
- **Next step**: Product team workshop to define analytics specifications
```

**Scenario 3: Scope Evolution**

```markdown
**Pattern**: Track feature movement between phases with reasoning
**Example**:

üîÑ EVOLVED: MVP Feature Scope

- **Initially**: "Full dashboard with real-time analytics" (ambitious vision)
- **Contracted to**: "Basic CRUD operations only" (timeline pressure)
- **Expanded to**: "CRUD + simple reporting" (user feedback priority)
- **Final**: "CRUD + export functionality, analytics in Phase 2" (compromise)
- **Evolution driver**: Balance between user needs and development timeline
```

## Quality Assurance Patterns

‚úÖ VERIFIED: "JWT tokens for API authentication" (engineering preference)

**Session 2 (Enterprise User Feedback)**:
üîÑ EVOLVED: Authentication requirements

- **Changed to**: "Must support SSO for enterprise compliance"
- **Trigger**: 80% of target users require corporate SSO integration
- **Impact**: JWT approach insufficient for enterprise market

**Session 3 (Implementation Planning)**:
üîÑ EVOLVED: Implementation approach

- **Refined to**: "OAuth 2.0 with SSO plugins for major providers"
- **Trigger**: Technical research showed OAuth supports both individual and enterprise users
- **Final decision**: Phase 1 OAuth, Phase 2 custom SSO integrations
```

### Pattern 11: Stakeholder Alignment Validation

**When to Use**: Ensuring extracted insights align with participant expectations

**Process**:

1. **Perspective Mapping**: Show how each stakeholder's input was captured
2. **Decision Attribution**: Link decisions to specific stakeholder input
