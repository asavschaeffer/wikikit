# WikiKit Decision Markers v2.0
# Standardized decision tracking markers for consistent extraction across all prompts

version: "2.0"
author: "Claude Sonnet 4
description: "Unified decision markers for tracking conversation evidence, evolution, and gaps"

# Core decision markers (consistent across ALL WikiKit prompts)
decision_markers:
  verified: "✅ VERIFIED: Explicitly stated - [quote/context]"
  derived: "📊 DERIVED: Inferred from [evidence] → [conclusion]"
  gap: "❌ GAP: Missing [critical info] → [consequences if unaddressed]"
  unclear: "❓ UNCLEAR: Mentioned but ambiguous - [specify what needs clarification]"
  assumption: "💡 ASSUMPTION: [assumption] based on [conversation evidence]"

  # v2.0 ADDITIONS
  evolution: "🔄 EVOLVED: Initially [X] → Changed to [Y] because [reason]"
  dependency: "🔗 DEPENDENCY: [item] blocks [other item] because [reason]"
  standard: "🏭 STANDARD: Industry practice for [context]"
  risk: "⚠️ RISK: [scenario] → [impact] → [mitigation]"

# Usage guidelines
usage_patterns:
  evidence_chain: "Always show logical reasoning for DERIVED markers: [evidence A] + [evidence B] → [conclusion]"
  evolution_tracking: "Use EVOLVED marker when conversation shows opinion changes with clear before/after and reasoning"
  gap_impact: "For GAP markers, always explain consequences: what happens if this missing info isn't resolved"
  clarification_specificity: "UNCLEAR markers must specify exactly what needs clarification, not just 'this is unclear'"

# Quality standards
quality_requirements:
  traceability: "Every marker must reference specific conversation content"
  consistency: "Use identical marker format across all document types"
  evidence_strength: "VERIFIED requires direct quotes, DERIVED requires logical chain"
  gap_criticality: "Only mark as GAP if missing information significantly impacts implementation"

# Marker selection guide
selection_guide:
  explicit_statements: "Use VERIFIED for direct quotes and clear statements"
  logical_inference: "Use DERIVED when connecting conversation dots with clear reasoning"
  opinion_changes: "Use EVOLVED when tracking how thinking changed throughout conversation"
  missing_critical_info: "Use GAP for essential information not discussed"
  ambiguous_mentions: "Use UNCLEAR when something was mentioned but not fully explored"
  dependencies: "Use DEPENDENCY for blocking relationships between items"
  industry_defaults: "Use STANDARD when applying common practices to fill conversation gaps"

# v2.0 conversation handling
conversation_complexity:
  contradictions: "When conversation contains conflicting statements, use EVOLVED to track the progression"
  half_formed_ideas: "Extract incomplete thoughts and mark as GAP with specific detail needed"
  stakeholder_disagreement: "Capture different perspectives with source attribution"
  alternative_approaches: "When multiple options discussed without decision, use UNCLEAR with all options listed"

# Examples by document type
document_specific_examples:
  requirements:
    - "✅ VERIFIED: 'Users must be able to export data as CSV' (user interview #3)"
    - "📊 DERIVED: Real-time updates needed → Inferred from 'data must always be current' + 'users check hourly'"
    - "🔄 EVOLVED: Initially 'email-only login' → Changed to 'OAuth + email' due to user research feedback"

  technical_feasibility:
    - "✅ VERIFIED: 'We'll use PostgreSQL' (explicitly decided in message #47)"
    - "🔗 DEPENDENCY: Database choice blocks API design because schema affects endpoints"
    - "⚠️ RISK: PostgreSQL scaling beyond 10TB → Performance degradation → Implement sharding strategy"

  roadmap:
    - "🔄 EVOLVED: Initially 'launch everything at once' → Changed to 'MVP + Phase 2' for faster validation"
    - "❌ GAP: No Phase 2 timeline discussed → Blocks resource planning and investor updates"
