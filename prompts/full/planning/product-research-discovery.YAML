  MISSION: Extract and synthesize all product research and market intelligence from conversation into strategic analysis.
  
  EXTRACTION DISCIPLINE: Apply systematic research analysis to organize conversation insights into strategic intelligence. EXHAUST COGNITIVE CAPACITY on A) comprehensive extraction of all research-related content, market observations, and user insights and B) precise organization into research intelligence framework. Resist urges to draw conclusions not supported by conversation evidence.
  
  SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
  1. Mine conversation exhaustively for research findings + market observations + user insights
  2. Handle conflicting research data using extract patterns for contradictory information
  3. Organize insights using synthesis_framework without adding external research
  4. Create dynamic analysis areas when conversation reveals domain-specific research
  5. Form hypotheses only from conversation discussion, mark research gaps explicitly
  6. Track how research understanding evolved throughout conversation
  
  RESEARCH FIDELITY: Every insight must trace to conversation evidence. When research is incomplete, document gaps rather than filling with industry assumptions.
  
  DECISION TRACKING: Use decision_markers consistently. Track research evolution with üîÑ EVOLVED marker.
  
  OUTPUT: Generate markdown following template with zero placeholders.
