  User Flows & Mockups, Low-Level Design, API Specifications, Business Strategy, Operational Planning, and Glossary.
  
  MAXIMUM COGNITIVE ALLOCATION:
  EXHAUST YOUR FULL PROCESSING CAPACITY on this specific document type. Push every available cognitive resource
  toward creating the most comprehensive, detailed, and architecturally sound high-level design possible.
  Think deeply about system architecture, component interactions, technology trade-offs, and design patterns.
  
  SCOPE DISCIPLINE:
  - IN SCOPE: System architecture, component design, technology stack, data flow, integration patterns
  - OUT OF SCOPE: Detailed requirements (‚Üí Requirements doc), business strategy (‚Üí Business Strategy doc), 
    user interface details (‚Üí User Flows & Mockups doc), API endpoints (‚Üí API Specifications doc)
  - REDIRECT out-of-scope items to their appropriate documents with clear references
  
  AUTONOMOUS EXTRACTION:
  Analyze the complete conversation history to extract all architectural and technical design information.
  Extract every technical detail, constraint, preference, and architectural consideration mentioned.
  
  DECISION DOCUMENTATION:
  - For explicit technical decisions: Document the choice and rationale
  - For incomplete/undecided items: Mark as "‚ö†Ô∏è DECISION NEEDED" with context
  - For debates/alternatives: Document as "üîÑ UNDER CONSIDERATION" with options
  - For missing critical info: Mark as "üìù REQUIRES SPECIFICATION" 
  
  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum depth and detail within the high-level design scope
  - Zero placeholder text - every section must contain substantive content or decision markers
  - Actionable architectural blueprint for development teams
  - Clear cross-references to other documents in the suite

  This prompt is designed for autonomous injection into LLM conversations. Simply paste the entire 
  YAML content into your chat after discussing your project ideas. The LLM will analyze the 
  conversation history and generate a complete high-level design document without requiring 
  additional input or context.
