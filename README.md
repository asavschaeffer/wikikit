# üåü WikiKit: AI Co-founder's Documentation Engine

> Transform scattered LLM brainstorming into surgical development blueprints

## üéØ Project Vision

**The Problem**: LLMs generate brilliant ideas during brainstorming but leave you with fragments when you need to build. Context gets lost between conversations, great insights get buried, and "just build it" requests produce generic code instead of precise implementations.

**The Solution**: A systematic documentation suite that captures the full intelligence of your brainstorming sessions and transforms it into implementation-ready blueprints for surgical development.

## üß† Core Philosophy: Surgical Development

Instead of asking an LLM to "build an entire app," break it into manageable, well-defined tasks:

1. **"Create the file structure for the `user_management` service as outlined in the LLD."**
2. **"Generate the `user_model.py` and `user_repository.py` files based on the provided SQLAlchemy schema."**
3. **"Write the `auth_controller.py` code. It should handle the `/register` endpoint, accept JSON with `email` and `password`, call `user_service.create_user`, and return a JWT token on success."**

This approach requires **comprehensive documentation** that captures every architectural decision, design pattern, and implementation detail from your brainstorming sessions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Two-Layer System

### Layer 1: YAML Superprompts (`/tree/main`)
Autonomous prompt injection system for extracting structured knowledge from LLM conversations:

- **Hybrid YAML Format**: Token-efficient structured parameters with markdown output templates
- **Cognitive Pressure Optimization**: Forces LLMs to exhaust processing capacity on specific document types
- **Extraction-Focused**: Transforms conversation intelligence into organized documentation
- **Wiki-Integrated**: Automatic cross-referencing and link generation

### Layer 2: GitHub Wiki Scaffold (`/wikikit.wiki`)
Pre-structured documentation framework that serves as the implementation foundation:

- **Document Suite Integration**: Each document feeds into and references others
- **Implementation-Ready**: Documents detailed enough for precise development requests
- **Cross-Referenced**: Automatic wiki linking creates navigable knowledge graph
- **Version Controlled**: Full documentation history and collaborative editing

## üìä Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Technical Document Prompts
- **High-Level Design**: System architecture and component interaction specs
- **Low-Level Design**: Implementation blueprints with code patterns and class structures  
- **API Specifications**: Complete endpoint documentation with request/response schemas

### ‚úÖ Completed Planning Document Prompts
- **Product Research & Discovery**: Market intelligence and strategic insight extraction

### üîÑ Sample Wiki Pages Generated
- High-Level Design scaffold with decision markers
- API Specifications example with realistic endpoint structures

## üéØ Prompt Engineering Breakthroughs

### Core Design Principles
- **Preserves Cognitive Resources**: Focus LLM processing on thorough extraction, not new ideation
- **Maintains Fidelity**: Every insight traceable to conversation content with evidence markers
- **Creates Clean Launch Pads**: Documents enable strategic thinking in downstream processes
- **Avoids Hallucination**: Explicit boundaries between conversation evidence and logical inference

### Key Technical Innovations

#### 1. **Hybrid YAML Architecture**
```yaml
# Token-efficient structured parameters
extraction_targets:
  technical_implementations: "Use bcrypt for password hashing, JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry"
  
# Combined with markdown output templates
output_template: |
  # Document Structure with {{dynamic}} interpolation
```
**Result**: 25-40% token reduction while maintaining human readability

#### 2. **Dynamic Adaptation System**
```yaml
code_adaptation:
  language_detection: "Analyze conversation for tech stack and adapt ALL examples"
  framework_alignment: "Align examples with mentioned frameworks"
```
**Result**: Context-aware documentation that matches project technology choices

#### 3. **Explicit Role Assignment**
```yaml
role_assignment:
  primary_role: "You are an experienced [domain expert]"
  task_context: "Extract and organize [specific type] insights"
```
**Result**: Clear cognitive framework eliminates LLM confusion about analytical perspective

#### 4. **Evidence-Grounded Decision Markers**
```yaml
confidence_markers:
  direct_evidence: "Directly stated in conversation with supporting context"
  pattern_inference: "üîç PATTERN: Synthesized from multiple conversation points"
  missing_critical_data: "‚ùå DATA GAP: Critical information not discussed"
```
**Result**: Transparent distinction between conversation facts and analytical inference

## üöÄ Strategic Impact

### For Individual Developers
- **Context Preservation**: Never lose architectural decisions or design rationale
- **Implementation Precision**: Request specific code implementations with full context
- **Knowledge Building**: Accumulate project intelligence across multiple LLM sessions

### For Development Teams  
- **Shared Understanding**: Single source of truth for all technical and strategic decisions
- **Onboarding Acceleration**: New team members get complete project context instantly
- **Cross-Functional Alignment**: Business strategy connects directly to technical implementation

### For Product Development
- **Research Intelligence**: Systematic capture of market insights and user feedback
- **Decision Traceability**: Clear reasoning chain from user needs to technical choices
- **Strategic Continuity**: Product vision remains consistent across development cycles
